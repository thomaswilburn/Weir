Weir
=======================

Components:
Reader - main class instantiates others
Hound - fetches RSS on a timer, dispatches events with new counts when the fetch concludes
Database.js - tech-specific database layer, start with pgsql
Console - logs out to a file (eventually) or to stdout (currently)
Config - key/value store loaded from JSON
Server - HTTP requests and AJAX calls
Stream - Registers stream-related routes/logic
Feeds - Registers feed-related routes/logic
Manos - utility functions for async without importing all of caolan's library
Freedom - import/export, starting with OPML
Security - Manage sessions, TOTP authorization

Client components (all namespaced as "Weir.*"):

SettingsController - handle showing and saving settings, plus showing security warning
FeedController - handle (un)subscribing, tagging
DisplayStack - manage major component visibility, dialogs, errors, warnings
Events - service for pubsub events, useful for scrolling and service notification
LocalSettings - Client-side preferences
Request - Wraps requests to handle security authorization and errors
Sanitize - Removes scripts, unwanted styles, defers images
Scroll - Throttles scroll events, provides scroll visibility directives
Server - Handles AJAX API and primary stream model
Main - contains primary app seed, random directives

Notes (vaguely ordered):

 - UX
  * make all buttons bigger on mobile
  * add "open current in new tab" button on mobile
  * add close button to hide activated items
  * Allow non-activation of top item, keyboard shouldn't freak out.
  
 - Add OPML export, now that I've got my feed list down

 - Create an actual App module, rewrite other modules more Angular-like
  * Manage keys at the app level, dispatch events in response

 - DisplayStack improvements
  * Real error/status messages
  * DisplayStack.dialog(), DisplayStack.confirm()
  * Hook ask(), Stream, Feed errors and confirmations into DisplayStack

 - Feed management improvements
  * Enable sorting of feeds by result, name, tag (eventually)
  * Add current story count to feeds, display

 - Logging:
  * Add different log levels and tagging
  * Feed log to file in addition to stdOut (allows running as job)

 - Remove CSS compilation from the Server, consider other handlers

 - Add ability to write server cfg.json with .save();

 - Weir.Sanitize improvements
  * Allow Weir.Sanitize to resize elements if they would be too big (scale movies, etc)
  * Add rudimentary ad/social blocking

 - Add to options service
  * refresh rate
  * key map - character/code to verb, then teach Stream to understand those
  * list length
  * buttons on sidebar

 - Add tags

 - Configure router to support REST params
 
 - Add SQLite support
